<p class = "am_text">My way in programming began at the end of the 10th grade, when I realized that I liked it. It was then that I made my first website in simple HTML/CSS.<br><br>
In the 11th grade, I took part in a hackathon, where I made up pages for the project (we won there by the way)<br><br>
    Well, then, by the will of fate, I was brought to Innopolis.For a whole year I've been thinking about what kind of programmer I want to be and now I realized that I'm very interested in developing websites and thinking through the interface!</p>
